# The Self-Paced Cybersecurity Degree
###### Design credit goes to [ForrestKnight](https://github.com/ForrestKnight)

This is a list of subjects, courses, and materials I am using to get into cybersecurity without a formal degree. The majority of it is free to low-cost. The biggest expenses are the certification tests themselves.

You can find the article I wrote regarding this list here: [Self Paced Cybersecurity Degree](https://jaacorn.com/posts/Cybersecurity-Degree)
